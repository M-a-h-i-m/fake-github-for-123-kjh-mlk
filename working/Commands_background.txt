step - 1 : (Initializing and staging)
------------------------------------------

01. What Happends When You Run git init?

==> Git creates a hidden folder called '.git' inside your project.
    This is where Git stores all the information it needs to track your files and history.

02. How to check it?
==> run 'ls -Force'


03. What Happens When You Run `touch <file_name>` command?
==> It creates a new empty file with the given name.If the file already 
    exists, it updates the file’s last modified time instead of creating a new one.


04. What Happens When You Run `git clone <remote_repository_url>` command?
==> Git downloads a copy of the remote repository to your computer.
    It also creates a connection to the remote repo so you can pull and push changes later.

05. What Happens When You Run `ls` command?
==> It shows the list of files and folders in the current directory.
    It helps you see what exists in your current location.


06. What Happens When You Run `git status` command?
==> It shows the current state of your repository.You can see which files 
    are modified, staged, or not tracked.


07. What Happens When You Run `clear` command?
==> It clears the terminal screen.


08. What Happens When You Run `pwd` command?
==> It shows the full path of your current directory.It helps you know 
    exactly where you are in the file system.


09. What Happens When You Run `git reset` command?
==> It removes files from the staging area.It does not delete the file, it 
    just unstages it.


10. What Happens When You Run `git add -A` command?
==> It adds all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) to the staging 
    area.It prepares everything for the next commit.


11. What Happens When You Run `git add --all` command?
==> It does the same thing as `git add -A`.It stages all changes in the 
    repository.


12. What Happens When You Run `git add .` command?
==> It adds all new and modified files from the current folder to the 
    staging area.It does not stage deleted files outside the current folder.


13. What Happens When You Run `git add <file_name>` command?
==> It adds only the specified file to the staging area.This lets you 
    commit specific files instead of everything.


14. What Happens When You Run `git add *` command?
==> It adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.It may .
    not include hidden files or deleted files


15. What Happens When You Run `git add *.txt (git add *<file_extension>)` command?
==> It adds all files with the specified extension (like .txt) to the 
    staging area.This lets you stage only specific types of files.
