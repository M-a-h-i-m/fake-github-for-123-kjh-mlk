step - 1 : (Initializing and staging)
------------------------------------------


01. What Happens When You Run `touch <file_name>` command?
==> It creates a new empty file with the given name.If the file already 
    exists, it updates the file’s last modified time instead of creating a new one.


02. What Happens When You Run `git clone <remote_repository_url>` command?
==> Git downloads a copy of the remote repository to your computer.
    It also creates a connection to the remote repo so you can pull and push changes later.


03. What Happends When You Run git init?
==> Git creates a hidden folder called '.git' inside your project.
    This is where Git stores all the information it needs to track your files and history.


04. How to check it?
==> run 'ls -Force'


05. What Happens When You Run `git add --all` command?
==> It does the same thing as `git add -A`.It stages all changes in the 
    repository.


06. What Happens When You Run `git add -A` command?
==> It adds all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) to the staging 
    area.It prepares everything for the next commit.


07. What Happens When You Run `git add .` command?
==> It adds all new and modified files from the current folder to the 
    staging area.It does not stage deleted files outside the current folder.


08. What Happens When You Run `git add <file_name>` command?
==> It adds only the specified file to the staging area.This lets you 
    commit specific files instead of everything.


09. What Happens When You Run `git add *` command?
==> It adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.It may .
    not include hidden files or deleted files


10. What Happens When You Run `git add *.txt (git add *<file_extension>)` command?
==> It adds all files with the specified extension (like .txt) to the 
    staging area.This lets you stage only specific types of files.


11. What Happens When You Run `git commit -m "<message>"` command?
==> It saves the staged changes as a new commit in the Git history. The 
    message helps describe what changes were made in that commit.

step - 2 : (Uses of git remove command)
---------------------------------------------


01. What Happens When You Run `git rm <file_name>` command?
==> It removes the file from your folder and also stages the removal. The 
    file will be deleted permanently after the next commit.


02. What Happens When You Run `git rm <file_name> -f` command?
==> It forcefully removes the file even if it has changes. It deletes the 
    file and stages the removal immediately.


03. What Happens When You Run `git rm --cached <file_name>` command?
==> It removes the file from Git tracking but keeps it in your folder. The 
    file will remain on your computer but Git will stop tracking it.

04. What Happens When You Run `git rm <folder_name>` command?
==> It tries to remove the folder from Git and your system. It will show 
    an error if the folder contains files and you don’t use the recursive option.


05. What Happens When You Run `git rm -r <folder_name>` command?
==> It removes the folder and all files inside it. The removal is also 
    staged for the next commit.

step - 3 : (Git Branching)
---------------------------------------------


1. What Happens When You Run `git branch` command?
==> It shows the list of all branches in your repository. The current 
    branch is highlighted with a star (*).


2. What Happens When You Run `git branch <branch_name>` command?
==> It creates a new branch with the given name. You remain on the current
    branch until you switch to the new branch.


3. What Happens When You Run `git checkout <branch_name>` command?
==> It switches you to the specified branch. Your working directory 
    updates to match that branch.


4. What Happens When You Run `git checkout main` command?
==> It switches you to the main branch. Your files update to the latest 
    state of the main branch.


5. What Happens When You Run `git merge <branch_name> -m "message"`
    command?     
==> It merges the specified branch into your current branch. The message
    describes the merge and is saved in the commit history.




________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

step - 4 : (push, fetch and pull)
---------------------------------------------

1. What Happens When You Run `git push origin main` command?
==> It uploads your local main branch commits to the remote repository. 
    This updates the remote main branch with your latest changes.


2. What Happens When You Run `git push origin <branch_name>` command?
==> It uploads the specified branch to the remote repository. This creates 
    or updates that branch on the remote.


03. What Happens When You Run `git push` command?
==> It uploads commits from your current branch to its connected remote 
    branch.It works only if the branch is already linked to a remote branch.


04. What Happens When You Run `git fetch` command?
==> It downloads new commits and updates from the remote repository. It 
    does not change your working files or current branch.

05. What Happens When You Run `git merge` command?
==> It combines changes from another branch into your current branch. This 
    creates a merge commit if there are new changes.


06. What Happens When You Run `git pull` command?
==> It downloads changes from the remote repository and merges them into 
    your current branch. It is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.

--------------


01. What Happens When You Run `clear` command?
==> It clears the terminal screen.


02. What Happens When You Run `pwd` command?
==> It shows the full path of your current directory.It helps you know 
    exactly where you are in the file system.


03. What Happens When You Run `ls` command?
==> It shows the list of files and folders in the current directory.
    It helps you see what exists in your current location.


04. What Happens When You Run `git reset` command?
==> It removes files from the staging area.It does not delete the file, it 
    just unstages it.


05. What Happens When You Run `git status` command?
==> It shows the current state of your repository.You can see which files 
    are modified, staged, or not tracked.



06. What Happens When You Run `git log` command?
==> It shows the commit history of the repository. You can see commit ID, 
    author,date, and commit message.


07. What Happens When You Run `git diff` command?
==> It shows the differences between modified files and the last commit. 
    This helps you see what changes you made before staging.


08. What Happens When You Run `git diff --staged` command?
==> It shows the differences between staged files and the last commit. This
    helps you review staged changes before committing.


09. What Happens When You Run `git reset HEAD~` command?
==> It removes the last commit but keeps the changes in your folder. The 
    changes will become unstaged.


10. What Happens When You Run `git reset --hard` command?
==> It removes staged changes and modified files permanently. Your
