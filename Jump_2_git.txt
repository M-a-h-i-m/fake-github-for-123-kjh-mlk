What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system.

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.



It is used for:

01. Tracking code changes
02. Tracking who made changes
03. Coding collaboration




Key Git Concepts:


01. Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
02. Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
03. Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
04. Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
05. Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
06. Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
07. Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
08. Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.





Working with Git:

01. Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
02. Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
03. When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
04. You select the modified files you want to Stage
05. The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot   
    of the files
06. Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
07. You can revert back to any previous commit.
08. Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track 
    of changes made in each commit!




Why Git?:
01. Over 70% of developers use Git!
02. Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
03. Developers can see the full history of the project.
04. Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.


Note: Most Git actions (like staging, committing, and viewing history) happen on your own computer.
Only Push and Pull interact with remote servers like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to upload or download changes.



What is GitHub?
01. Git is not the same as GitHub.
02. GitHub makes tools that use Git.
03. GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by  
    Microsoft since 2018.
04. In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.



🔹Stages:
---------------------|
U - Untracked        |
A - Added or Staged  |
C - Committed        |
M - Modified         |
---------------------|

Commands you needs to know----->>>>

git status -s --> To know the current status of unstaged and staged files
git log --oneline --> To know the current status of saved point
git log --oneline --graph --> To know the current status of saved point
***GitHub Commands***:

---

## 🔹 Setup & Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
git config --list   # check current config
```


---

## 🔹 Working with Remote (GitHub)

```bash
git remote -v                                # check remote repos
git remote add origin <repo-url>             # connect to GitHub
git push -u origin main                      # push first time
git push                                     # push changes
git pull                                     # fetch + merge from remote
git fetch                                    # fetch without merge
```

---

## 🔹 Undoing Changes

git restore <file>               # undo unstaged changes
git reset <file>                 # unstage a staged file
git reset --hard HEAD            # reset all to last commit
git checkout <commit-id> <file>  # restore file from commit
```

---

## 🔹 Collaboration

git pull origin main             # get latest changes
git merge origin/main            # merge remote into local
git rebase origin/main           # reapply commits on top
git stash                        # save changes temporarily
git stash pop                    # apply stashed changes
```

---

## 🔹 Tags & Releases

```bash
git tag v1.0.0                   # create tag
git tag                          # list tags
git push origin v1.0.0           # push tag to GitHub
```

---

## 🔹 GitHub CLI (optional but powerful)

If you install GitHub CLI (`gh`):

```bash
gh repo create                   # create repo on GitHub
gh issue list                    # list issues
gh pr create                     # create pull request
gh pr checkout <id>              # check out PR branch
```

Create a new repository on the command line:
-------------------------------------------------

echo "# Git_-_Github_Note" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <URL>
git push -u origin main



________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

push an existing repository from the command line:
-----------------------------------------------------

git remote add origin <URL>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main





____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. What Happens When You Run `echo "# Git_-_Github_Note" >> README.md` command?
==> It creates a README.md file if it does not exist and adds the text inside it.
    If the file already exists, it appends the text to the end of the file.


2. What Happens When You Run `git init` command?
==> It creates a new local Git repository in your project folder. A hidden
   `.git` folder is created to track changes.


3. What Happens When You Run `git add README.md` command?
==> It stages the README.md file. This prepares the file to be included
    in the next commit.


4. What Happens When You Run `git commit -m "first commit"` command?
==> It saves the staged files as the first commit in the repository history.
    The message describes the commit.


5. What Happens When You Run `git branch -M main` command?
==> It renames the current branch to main. The `-M` forces the rename
   even if a branch named main already exists.


6. What Happens When You Run `git remote add origin <URL>` command?
==> It connects your local repository to a remote repository. The name
   "origin" is used as the default remote reference.


7. What Happens When You Run `git push -u origin main` command?
==> It uploads your main branch to the remote repository. The `-u` sets
    the upstream connection for future push and pull commands.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What Happens When You Run `git remote add origin <URL>` (for existing repo)?
==> It links your existing local repository to a remote repository. This
   allows you to push your existing commits online.


9. What Happens When You Run `git branch -M main` (for existing repo)?
==> It renames your current branch to main. This ensures the branch name
    matches the remote branch.


10. What Happens When You Run `git push -u origin main` (for existing repo)?
==> It uploads your existing commits to the remote repository. It also
    sets the branch to track origin/main for future pushes.
