What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system.

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.



It is used for:

01. Tracking code changes
02. Tracking who made changes
03. Coding collaboration




Key Git Concepts:


01. Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
02. Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
03. Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
04. Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
05. Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
06. Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
07. Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
08. Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.





Working with Git:

01. Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
02. Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
03. When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
04. You select the modified files you want to Stage
05. The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot   
    of the files
06. Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
07. You can revert back to any previous commit.
08. Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track 
    of changes made in each commit!




Why Git?:
01. Over 70% of developers use Git!
02. Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
03. Developers can see the full history of the project.
04. Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.


Note: Most Git actions (like staging, committing, and viewing history) happen on your own computer.
Only Push and Pull interact with remote servers like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to upload or download changes.



What is GitHub?
01. Git is not the same as GitHub.
02. GitHub makes tools that use Git.
03. GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by  
    Microsoft since 2018.
04. In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
